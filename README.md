"# FIFO-and-LIFO-method-analysis" 


Task information:
Grain Warehouse (ADT: stack, row). The company is trading grain. Every day the company
buys and stores grain and sells it (occurs from 0 to 100% of grain in stock). There is a
fixed daily grain rate (eg. 100 t) and purchase price (eg. 200 EUR / t), but
it is natural that all the same consequences are not visible, so the amount of grain known to be purchased is expertly known
the maximum deviation (eg. 15%, which means that all-day businesses buy 85-115 t of grain) and
maximum deviation of grain purchase prices (eg. 5%, which means that the company buys grain after 190-
210 EUR / t). The "grain company for sale" set a mark-up (for example, 10%) on the accounting grain prices.
The following inventory accounting methods are available: 1) FIFO repurchase: sold first
the oldest grain purchased, the book price of the grain being equal to the purchase price; 2) LIFO weighted averages:
the freshest grains sold first; the book price of the grain received is determined as at your time
weighted average of the prices of cereals in storage (eg. if 200 tonnes of cereals are used in storage, the
the book price is 95 EUR / t and 100 tons are purchased at 110 EUR / t, the book price of grain is 100
EUR / t = (200 * 95 + 100 * 110) / (200 + 100)). Objective: to investigate, to choose the method of grain accounting
using the companyâ€™s higher profits.
